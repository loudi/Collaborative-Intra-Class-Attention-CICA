# Collaborative-Intra-Class-Attention-CICA-
This repository proposes an approach to enhance the Vision Transformer (ViT) using Collaborative Intra-Class Attention (CICA). The proposed method aims to strengthen intra-class feature relationships in order to improve image classification performance, particularly in scenarios where visual similarities across different classes make discrimination challenging. The approach has been integrated into ViT and evaluated on five datasets.
